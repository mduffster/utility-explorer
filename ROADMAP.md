# Roadmap

## Potential Integrations

- **Slack** - Pull DMs and mentions into inbox
- **Twitter/X** - Track DMs and mentions
- **Todoist/Linear** - Sync external task managers
- **Notion** - Pull tasks from databases
- **Local git** - Option to scan local repos instead of GitHub API

## Feature Ideas

### AI Enhancements
- `ue draft <id>` - AI-generate response for inbox item
- Smarter focus recommendations based on time of day and energy levels

### Monthly Tracking
- `ue month` - Month-in-review command
- Monthly block targets in addition to weekly
- Trend analysis ("workout 4/5 weeks, blog slipping")

### Task Improvements
- Natural language task entry: `ue task "follow up with John next tuesday"`
- Recurring tasks (not just blocks)
- Task dependencies

### Other
- `ue week` - Weekly summary/review
- Export to markdown for journaling
- Notifications/reminders (system notifications or email digest)
